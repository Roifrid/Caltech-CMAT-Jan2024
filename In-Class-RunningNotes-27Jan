Every Playbook in Ansible includes following sections:

> Tasks
      > loop
      > condition
      > tags
> Vars
> vars_files
> Handlers
> files directory
> jinja2 templates

Writing all the sections in a single file will be difficult to manage and troubleshoot

If your playbook is having many tasks or many variables and is using templaes, handlers -> writing everything ina  single file is not a best approach

So Ansible comes with concept called Ansible Roles

Ansible Roles is a way of managing or writing your playbooks

Ansible Roles are nothing but set of directories, These directories consist of various sections of playbook

Basically with Ansible roles we are breaking down a playbook in several several directoires/files

In the directoires we have empty YAML files, in which we can write ansible code.

The number of directories and names of the directories are fixed and is provided by Ansible

Once the Role is ready, we call the role in a playbook.

In a playbook we can call many Roles


ROLES  => rolename => apache

	1. First directory in a ROLE ==> another directory gets created with name as  => tasks
		> main.yml
                         >The main.yml file will be present in the tasks directory.
				> in this file we write the tasks to be executed by ansible on the worker nodes
Example:

  - name: read package value from list
     debug: msg="the package is {{pkgs[0]}}
   - name: install package
     yum: name={{pkgs[0]}} state=present
   - name: read package value as maps
     debug: msg="the package is {{pkgs2.linux}}
   - name: Install package
     yum: name={{pkgs2.linux}} state=present

	2. Second Directory in the ROLE ==> vars directory
               > main.yml
                         >The main.yml file will be present in the vars directory.
                              > in this file we write the names of variables and their values that are used by tasks
                                
example:

pkgs:
 - docker
 - git
 - wget

pkgs2:
 linux: httpd
 ubuntu: apache2

	3. Third Directory in the Role  => defaults directory
			> main.yml
                         >The main.yml file will be present in the defaults directory.
                              > in this file we write the names of variables and their values that are used by tasks


	4. Fourth Directory in the role  => templates directory
			> jinja2 file => all .j2 files will be present
				> In this directory we will prepare the jinja2 templates. that our task will copy on worker nodes

	5. Fifth Directory in the role  => files directory
			> Any kind of files will be present
				> In this directory we will prepare the files. that our task will copy on worker nodes



	6. Sixth Directory in the role => Handlers directory
                    > > main.yml
                         >The main.yml file will be present in the handlers directory.
				> In this directory we will write handlers tasks which are executed on notification.



How will the roles be executed

> with help of playbook

 - hosts: webserver
   become: true
   roles:
     - packgeinstall   execution==> tasks ==> vars==> templates==>handlers
     - apache2           execution==> tasks ==> vars==> templates==>handlers
