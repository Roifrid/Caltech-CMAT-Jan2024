Ansible Playbooks:
==================================================

> Playbooks are used in Ansible to write configuration code
> Whenver we ahve to do many chnages on varaious host we use playbook
> whenever we want to use variable, conditions, loops we use playbooks
> playbook allows us to reuse the code, save the code in VCS
> Playbooks can be shared within the team and other users can exeucte them
> Playbook can also be exeucted by Jenkins

Playbook consist of 3 main information:

1. Hosts ==>  host group where chnages will be done

2. User details ==> which user will exeucte the tasks of the playbook, not mandatory

3. tasks ==> modules which have to be exeucted on servers, Mandatory section of playbook

Playbook Structure:
=========================

A playbook can consist of multiple plays

---

- name: This is play1
  hosts: webserver
  tasks: # multiple tasks
  - name: anytext over here describe the nature of the task
    modulename: key=value key=value
  - name: another task2
    modulename: key1-value key2=value

=============================

Command to check ansible playbook Synatx is correct or not

# ansible-playbook <playbookname> --syntax-check

Execution of playbook command:


# ansible-playbook <playbookname>

============================

1. Debug Module:
=============================
This module prints statements during execution and also prints value of variables

To print message we use parameter => msg: "Hello"
To print value of a variables we use parameter => var: var1 

2. Register:
=======================
What is a variable : a variable is a memory location whcih stores a value

> Ansible Register is a way to capture the output from a task execution 
> Ansible register stores the output in a variable
> This is an important feature of ansible, as ouput of every host server is different
> Register variable will store data differently for each hosts

Use of register variable:

 > register variable cna used to for setting conditions in playbook

Example: If i want to check if docker service is up or not on all host servers, 

I may exeucte a command: systemctl status docker

Its output needs to be stored somehwere --> it stores in register variable

This varibale can then be used further inyour playbook
=====================================

Variables in playbook:

========================================
> just like in any programming or scripting language variables are used to save some data.
> same is the concept in Ansible playbooks also.
> In ansible a value is assigned to a variable, this value is then reffered in the playbook or at the runtime
> Variables in ansible can be used in Playbooks, commandline, inventory file
> Variables are of 2 types:
    - custom Variable
       - variable where name and value is given by user

    - Fact variables/magical variables/special variable
       - These are variables provided by Ansible
       - There name and value is given by ansible - pre defined by ansible
       - user will not change the value
       - These variable store complete information about your host servers
       - Fact variables will always start with ansible keyword

Custom Variables:
==========================

These are the set of rules to be follwoed while giving name to the variables in ansible:

> A valid variable name can start with uppercase or lower case
> A valid variable will conatiner, letters, digits and _
> not give custom varible name starting with ansible or python keyword or playbook keyword
> prefferd that give a short and meanigful name to a variable

Example valid variable name:

 country
 pkg_name
 week_day
 country001
 PKG_STATE

Example of some invalid variables:

 #country
 pkg-name
 234pkg
 @weekday


> variables can be defined and reffered in a playbook

1. A simple variable storing single value:

Variables in a playbook are written in seperate section above tasks section which is called as vars
In vars section your give variable and its value

{{variable_name}} refering to the value of the variable

Scope of the variable is only in this playbook

Example:

- hosts: webserver
  vars:   # defining variable
   user: admin
  tasks:
  - name: print username
    debug: 
     msg: "the value is : {{user}}" refering to the value of the variable
  - name: execute command
    command: ls /tmp
    register: store_data

2. variable storing multiple values in vars block:

   vars:
    pkg_name:
     - tree
     - wget
     - nano
    user:
     name: alice
     age: 32     

3. Variables can be defined outside the playbook in a seperate YAML file and refer the variable in your playbook.
This can be acheived using vars_files block
